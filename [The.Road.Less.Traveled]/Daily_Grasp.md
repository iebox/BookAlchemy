# The road less traveled.

## 1. Problems and Pain.

- I should've kept my mind positive by accepting complete responsibility for myself and for everything that happened to me.
- I should've refused to criticize others, complained, or blamed others for anything.
- I should've resolved to make progress rather than excuses.


## 2. Delaying Gratification

I've been engaging in unconscious procrastination. I've been procrastinating without thinking. As a result, I've been procrastinating on the big, valuable, important tasks that can have significant long-term consequences in my live and career. It's time to put an end on this. to avoid this common tendency at all costs.

Control your thoughts. Remember, you become what you think about most of the time. Be sure that you are thinking and talking about the things you want rather than the things you don’t want.


## 3. The Sins of the Father

If our parents failed to ship us the value or didn't set valuable examples during our childhood, it's a good thing. This is a perfect chance for us to experience the importance of the missing pieces - courage and kindness. I've got my father's temper and I'm emotionally inarticulate. However, I want to bequeath to my children courage and kindness instead. There is one prerequisite - I myself must "Have Courage, and Be Kind."


## 4. Problem-Solving and Time

Just like in debt with money, problem requires a brutal interest rate, which explains why no one could afford the delayed pay off. If I encounter some problems, and I know I want to solve this problem for greater good someday, it might as well be today. Fortunately, Problem solving skills are learnable through practice and repetition. With more problem solved comes seasoned experience, as a result, increasingly contributes to our self-confidence, which is the key to solve future insurmountable problems.


## 5. Responsibility
Look at the word responsibility—“response-ability”—the ability to choose your response. Highly proactive people recognize that responsibility. They do not blame circumstances, conditions, or conditioning for their behavior.

If the traffic and the stick-shift car are problems only for you, not for others, then chances are, you are part of the problems, not part of the solution, 'cause the significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them.

If you have time to whine and complain about something then you have the time to do something about it.


## 6. Neuroses and Character Disorders

I have, by conscious decision or by default, chosen to empower conditions to control me.
In making such a choice, I become reactive. Instead of being a part of the solution, I become a part of the problem.

I've been affecting by my physical and social environment. When people treat me well, I feel well; when people don’t, I become defensive or protective. I built my emotional live around the behavior of others, empowering the weaknesses of other people to control me.

Now I'm willing to carry my own weather with me. Whether it rains or shines makes no difference to me. I want to be value driven; and if my value is to produce good quality work, it isn’t a function of whether the weather is conducive to it or not.

## 7. Escape from Freedom

Most of us don't like our current jobs. But we give away the freedom of choosing our dream jobs, under the excuses of personal or family responsibilities, etc. As a result, we've been working on jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. And I've done my share, for years.

To get back on track with freedom, we have to make a choice, and then enjoy the good result, or suffer through the consequences. Instead of regretting the choices being made before, make new choices, right choices now.

No previous choices worth regretting, except the default choices - choices haven't been made once there was chances. No choice is also a choice, and most certainly a bad choice. Don't give up the freedom to make any choice, go make it, or break it.


## 8. Dedication to Reality

If life is all about traveling, the sooner, clearer the map we get, the easier, better life we'll lead.
When we don't have a map, the world looks different from when we do. Think about how are we following directions literally nowadays. Could you find out where to go without a GPS powered phone with LBS app's support?

Here is a vivid example, a dialog between a ordinary man and a map powered one.

- [w/o map] People've been clowning me about this jacket since I got here, but
if I take it off to make them happy, that just makes me weak, right?
- [w/ map] Listen. It doesn't matter. You lose the jacket to please them.
You keep it to piss them off. Either way it's for them. That's what's weak.

That's why we all need to build our own mind maps, to help ourselves find life directions, and better yet, help people around us. Life is too short to take any detour.


## 9. Transference: The Outdated Map

Transference is that set of ways of perceiving and responding to the world which is developed in childhood and which is usually **entirely appropriate to the childhood** environment (indeed, often life-saving) but which is **inappropriately transferred into the adult environment**.

Truth or reality is avoided when it is painful.
we must always hold truth, as best we can determine it, to be more important, more vital to our self-interest, than our comfort.

There was a map I got from my father when I was young: disrespect your inferiors. I was raised watching my father yelling at waiters, coworkers, and even strangers. I didn't know it was wrong and didn't even realized that we're doing this, until my late 20s. It was a night, I was on a bus, going home after work. I saw a young man yelling at conductor for some reason. The young man was so pathetic. Then I suddenly realized that I was pathetic, 'cause I've been act like him for a long time. Then I did a map fix. Being nice to people was the right way to go.

Ever since then, I started to act nice, and for the 1st time in my life, I feel so good.

## 10. Openness to Challenge

The sources of danger to the world lie more within us than outside, and that the process of constant self-examination and contemplation is essential for ultimate survival.

I used to work in Amazon where challenge is a daily dozen. At the very beginning, I can't blend in. My manager showed me all the SOP for giving me the guts to fall in love of deadly challenge, which actually opens me up to life.


## 11.Withholding Truth

A real conflict may arise when
- the desire for total honesty is opposed by
- the needs of some people for certain kinds of protection.

burdens by need to hide:
- to slink around in the shadows.
- to construct new lies to hide old ones.
- waste effort covering tracks or maintaining disguises.

The ignored truth:

- the energy required for the self-discipline of honesty is far less than
- the energy required for secretiveness.

- The more honest one is,
- the easier it is to continue being honest,

- the more lies one has told,
- the more necessary it is to lie again.


Above all, I want to be secure and proud in the knowledge that I have done nothing to contribute to the confusion of the world, but have served as sources of illumination and clarification.



## 12.Balancing

To be free people we must assume total responsibility for ourselves, but in doing so must possess the capacity to reject responsibility that is not truly ours.

Thus it is necessary that the higher centers of our brain (judgment) be able to regulate and modulate the lower centers (emotion).

We'd better express anger only after much deliberation and self-evaluation. At other times it is more to our benefit to express it immediately and spontaneously. Sometimes it is best to express it coldly and calmly; at other times loudly and hotly.

The loss of balance is ultimately more painful than the giving up required to maintain balance. In one way or another it is a lesson I have continually had to relearn throughout my life.

If something got in my way. So it had to go. The times have changed. To move with them I had to give it up. I do not miss it. I thought I would, but I don’t.

## 13. The Healthiness of Depression

A clear defined a problem is a problem half solved. For instance, the act of deciding to seek psychiatric attention in itself represents a honest acknowledgement of the self-image “I’m not OK, I need help." It's not a sign of weakness, but a sign of courage.

I'm ready to let the old and outdated part of me go, to make room for renewal.


## 14. Renunciation and Rebirth
Awareness of what presents itself to me involves a double movement of attention: silencing the familiar and welcoming the strange.

> - “Throughout the whole of life one must continue to learn to live,”
> - “and what will amaze you even more, throughout life one must learn to die.”
<div style="text-align: right"> - said Seneca two millennia ago. </div>

Because there is a vacuum of competence in the world which must be filled. You must forge for yourself an identity before you can give it up, by starting at the beginning and go through the middle.

Discipline has been defined as a system of techniques of dealing constructively with the pain of problem-solving—instead of avoiding that pain—in such a way that all of life’s problems can be solved.

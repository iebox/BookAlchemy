### 1. Problems and Pain.

- I should've kept my mind positive by accepting complete responsibility for myself and for everything that happened to me.
- I should've refused to criticize others, complained, or blamed others for anything.
- I should've resolved to make progress rather than excuses.


### 2. Delaying Gratification

I've been engaging in unconscious procrastination. I've been procrastinating without thinking. As a result, I've been procrastinating on the big, valuable, important tasks that can have significant long-term consequences in my live and career. It's time to put an end on this. to avoid this common tendency at all costs.

Control your thoughts. Remember, you become what you think about most of the time. Be sure that you are thinking and talking about the things you want rather than the things you don’t want.


### 3. The Sins of the Father

If our parents failed to ship us the value or didn't set valuable examples during our childhood, it's a good thing. This is a perfect chance for us to experience the importance of the missing pieces - courage and kindness. I've got my father's temper and I'm emotionally inarticulate. However, I want to bequeath to my children courage and kindness instead. There is one prerequisite - I myself must "Have Courage, and Be Kind."


### 4. Problem-Solving and Time

Just like in debt with money, problem requires a brutal interest rate, which explains why no one could afford the delayed pay off. If I encounter some problems, and I know I want to solve this problem for greater good someday, it might as well be today. Fortunately, Problem solving skills are learnable through practice and repetition. With more problem solved comes seasoned experience, as a result, increasingly contributes to our self-confidence, which is the key to solve future insurmountable problems.


### 5. Responsibility
Look at the word responsibility—“response-ability”—the ability to choose your response. Highly proactive people recognize that responsibility. They do not blame circumstances, conditions, or conditioning for their behavior.

If the traffic and the stick-shift car are problems only for you, not for others, then chances are, you are part of the problems, not part of the solution, 'cause the significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them.

If you have time to whine and complain about something then you have the time to do something about it.


### 6. Neuroses and Character Disorders

I have, by conscious decision or by default, chosen to empower conditions to control me.
In making such a choice, I become reactive. Instead of being a part of the solution, I become a part of the problem.

I've been affecting by my physical and social environment. When people treat me well, I feel well; when people don’t, I become defensive or protective. I built my emotional live around the behavior of others, empowering the weaknesses of other people to control me.

Now I'm willing to carry my own weather with me. Whether it rains or shines makes no difference to me. I want to be value driven; and if my value is to produce good quality work, it isn’t a function of whether the weather is conducive to it or not.


We've been working on jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need.

1) Acquire | The point at which information enters through your eyes and ears. Reading, taking notes in a class or personal experiences are all part of the Acquire Phase. The goal here is to get accurate information in the most compressed form.
2) Understand | Understanding means taking raw information and giving it a context. This would be the most basic interlinking you would need to perform in order to learn.
3) Explore | The Explore Phase is really where holistic learning takes full force. Here you form the models, highways and broader connections needed for well defined constructs.
4) Debug | The Debug Phase looks for errors in your models and highways. This phase prunes back your connections so invalid ones won’t remain, or will be constrained to the area they work.
5) Apply | The Apply Phase takes debugging to the final level by making adjustments compared to how this information operates in reality. Having a set of understandings is useless if they aren’t tailored to the real world. Failure on this step could be an example of people who have book-smarts but can’t seem to use them outside the class.
